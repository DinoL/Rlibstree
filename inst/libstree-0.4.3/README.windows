These are notes on what I changed and what one does to 
build inst/libstree/ before installing the R package.


Changes
------------------------
We have added different include directives to 
  lst_structs.h
  lst_string.h
  lst_stree.h
for WIN32. Also, we have included a copy of queue.h
(from Linux) to provide the LIST_ENTRY, etc. macros.
The includes we added are 
  "queue.h"
  <windows.h>

which seems to cover almost everything we need.
We also define u_int32_t as 'unsigned int'.
